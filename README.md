# Bernoullis-Functions
These are a set of functions to help solve simple fluid flow problems.

All of these basic functions are derived from Bernoulli's equation, simply by re-arranging for the desired variable.

Suitable for use in simple problems where the balance between pressure, velocity, elevation, and gravity needs to be investigated.

Remember the following assumptions apply to Bernoulli's equation:
- The points investigated lie on a streamline
- Fluid has constant density
- Flow is steady and frictionless
